# DFS Implementation in Python

The python notebook consists of a max flow extension implementation of min cost flow and its linear programming solution

## Components

* create_graph - create a directed graph as specified by the input file. Edges are annotated with 'capacity' and 'weight' attributes, and nodes are annotated with 'demand' attributes
* lp_flow_value - function to compute the value of the minimum cost flow by formulating and solving the problem as an LP
